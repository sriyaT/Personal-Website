        <span>Hi Folks,</span>
        <p>
          I'm self-taught Front-End Web Developer,I got a strong motivation to
          change my career. I picked up ... Web Development, it's easy to learn,
          creative platform to express my skills through building applications
          or websites, got high popularity on market, hmmm...seems suitable for
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          then I spend time , learning Web Development(HTML5, CSS3, Js) day and
          night, taking courses from udemy to youtube channels, then I find out
          thereâ€™s a Library called "React" that can be used to build web
          Applications, does emphasize on component approach, which is amazing!
        </p>

          I didn't stop here ofCourse, This is just the beginning of my journey
          to become a front-end developer and it's been a year i'm into this and
          Learned as many skills came on my way like "React router", "Redux",
          "Firebase" and Deploying all that..., And Now I have build some of
          projects right there on "Projects" section.
